        "description": "Crypto is following the same path as monetary policy in the early years, repeating the same mistakes it made before. The dragon slayer may be slowly turning into the dragon. Wave after wave of Crypto has iterated it into something else. Crypto culture has killed the Crypto spirit. Indeed, it's as if that's really the case. We no longer prioritize our core values(decentralization, security, privacy, ownership, innovation), but rather focus on the excitement of short-term greed (fomo and hype). This is a sad state of Crypto.",

In order to achieve this, Cosmos provides developer tools to significantly cut the time and labor, including the Tendermint consensus engine, the modular development framework of the Cosmos SDK, and the IBC communication protocol to realize the transfer of information and assets between blockchains and open up different blocks. Before understanding the development ideas of Cosmos, let’s take a brief review of the history of blockchain.",
