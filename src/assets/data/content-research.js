Wave after wave of Crypto has iterated it into something else. Crypto culture has killed the Crypto spirit. Indeed, it's as if that's really the case. We no longer prioritize our core values(decentralization, security, privacy, ownership, innovation), but rather focus on the excitement of short-term greed (fomo and hype). This is a sad state of Crypto.",
